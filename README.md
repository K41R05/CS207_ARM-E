# CS207_NEO-ARM (originally named ARM-E)

This project was made for CS207 and has been an interest of mine for a long time.

Currently, the project has made use of Mahdi Hussein's Prosthetic Arm Files, with some slight alterations particularly in the wiring of the fishing line.

At present moment this project is simplified to the prosthetic hand responding to a reading from the Myoware Muscle sensors.

Future endevaours I want to explore:
- looking into better supplier for Servo Motors (some of my sensors only moved 180 degrees, and other sensors would rotate 360 degrees)
